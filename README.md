# Overview

This is a calculator, that will take a number and return the factorial of that number (ie: for 4 it would be 4*3*2*1). The calculation is being done recursively.

This was to get started in the Rust language and understand how to use it.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with the Rust analyzer expansion installed. I also used a library to open a webpage called webbrowser (I included the link further down)

# Useful Websites

- [visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust)
- [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/webbrowser/1.0.2)

# Future Work

- As of right now it can only go up to the number 12, after that I will run into memory issues. So this could be improved.
- There could be a proper UI. So I could add that.
